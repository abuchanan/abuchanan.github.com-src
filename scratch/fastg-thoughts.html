proliferation of formats is bad

we're not utilizing existing formats with very strong qualities
- JSON

why is JSON the best option


ya, i can convert fastg to fasta easily, but then i must maintain both
very large files


seriously, does anyone really look at fasta files in a text editor?
when is that useful?


people will have to write additional parsers for all this


proposed benefits of "linear representation"
- matches linearity of genome
- natural coordinates
- easy to read and interpret
--- fastg is not easy to interpret
- universe of tools
--- all those tools must change to adapt to fastg


don't try to cram too much information into one file

prevents efficient access to data because the entire
genome sequence must be parsed to access them


i'm sure fastg is missing support for some sort of nonlinear data
and then the format will need to change to support that, starting
this ridiculous cycle all over


how to these mid-line tags deal with the 70-80 character line widths
common to fasta?


to use fastg data in tools, i have to parse it out into a separate 
data structure anyway.  don't make me do that, just give it to me
separately to begin with.

there is very little reason to have this data inline.



hacking complicated graphs into a text file isn't the solution.  we should
be shuttling people into an age of advanced visualization tools, not archaic 
text file formats.


when you find yourself writing a section on number format grammar, you're doing
something wrong.  that's been done.  KISS




libraries parsing fastg will inevitably come up with their own attributes names
for the fields that aren't specified in the spec.  once again, JSON would
alleviate this issue
