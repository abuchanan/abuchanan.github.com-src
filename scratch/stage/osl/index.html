  <p>This was my first "real job" working on software. As a web developer, I worked with mostly <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a>.</p>
  <p>The OSL was a fantastic place to work as a student.  The projects taught me many things I still use every day, and being emersed in the open source world led me to fall in love with its ideas.</p>
