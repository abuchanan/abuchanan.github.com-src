<p>Web development with Mozilla was one of the best and most educational experiences I've had, helping me grow from a greenhorn to a professional.  Working with brilliant collegues in a fast paced enviroment on projects that scale up to millions of users a week made every day interesting.</p>

      <h3>Army of Awesome</h2>
      <p>Community support and engagement web application, built with Twitter and Django, hosted under support.mozilla.com.</p>

      <h2>Email Engagement Campaign</h2>
      <p>Large, long term project to boost email engagement, included migrating email providers and implementing many new engagement points on mozilla.com</p>

      <h2>Mozilla.com redesign and reorganization</h2>
      <p></p>

      <h2>EU Browser Settlement</h2>
      <p>The European Union and Microsoft <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1948381,00.html">settled a 10-year antitrust case</a>, creating the need for a special download page.</p>
      <p>This was a challenging project. It was high profile (lots of important people paying close attention) and high traffic (potentially tens of millions of downloads over many years).</p>
      <p>The project was very quickly paced.  The time between the court decision and deployment was short, and the deadline was frequently changing, and the terms of the final court decision were uncertain.</p>
      <p>Collaboration with Microsoft added additional challenges, such as deploying the final page to their servers.  There was very little room for error on a project with many fast moving pieces.</p>
      <p>Such circumstances make for a very rewarding and fulfilling project, and this turned out smooth and successful.</p>

      <h2>L10n</h2>
      <p>One of my favorite parts of Mozilla was interacting with the large community of localizers.  Mozilla is an international community, so most of its products are translated and localized into dozens of languages.</p>
      <p>Working with an international community was great.  Learning to build websites in dozens of languages was very valuable, and communicating between far away places was educational too.</p>

      <h2>World Cup</h2>
      <p>This community engagement project centered around the 2010 World Cup.  It was built with Python and Django and hosted on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

      <h2>Spread Firefox</h2>
      <p>Spread Firefox was a hub for community marketing activities, allowing users to organize projects using tools like forums and calendars.  It also hosted marketing news, resources, and the Affiliates program.</p>
      <p>This site was <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/website-archive/2011/02/25/spread-firefox/">retired</a> in early 2011.</p>
      <p>I helped maintain this site for years, doing both small tasks and large projects, including a redesign, backend tools, and security updates.</p>

      <h2>Affiliates</h2>
      <p>A Firefox affiliate would post a download button on their blog or website.  Downloads from this button were tracked and reported to the affiliate.  Metrics were shared among the community, and prizes could be won.</p>
      <p>During product releases, these buttons could drive potentially millions of downloads a day.</p>
      <p>For me, this included supporting code for every aspect: launching new buttons, parsing traffic logs, building metrics, data warehousing, and creating reports.</p>

      <h2>product launches</h2>
      <p>firefox - frequent support for minor releases, and logistics, implementation, and support for large scale releases.</p>

      <h2>Firefox Mobile</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/">Firefox Mobile</a> was born, creating bevy of projects.  Mozilla.com needed a new set of product pages and those needed to be translated into dozens of languages (and then redesigned and reimplemented frequently).  Mobile phones needed to be detected, so that pages could be styled appropriately, and download buttons could return the proper file (a tricky task!).</p>

      <h2>Page Optimization</h2>
      <p>We implemented page use tracking and tests to accomplish goals such as increasing download converstion and retetion rates.

      <h2>Intern Mentor</h2>
      <p>Mentoring an intern was a great experience, which taught me a lot about management.</p>

      <h2>Interviews</h2>
      <p>Sitting on the other side of the interview table was fun and educational.</p>

      <h2>Community Store</h2>
      <p>We built a PHP site from scratch to sell prints designed by the community.</p>

      <h2>Kubla</h2>
      <p>CMS for mozilla.com, built with SVN and Drupal.</p>

      <h2>Headrush</h2>
      <p>Headrush was a feedback and brainstorming site, similar to Dell's <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/">IdeaStorm</a>.</p>

      <h2>air.mozilla.com</h2>
      <p>I set up a simple page for broadcasting video from weekly meetings to the community.</p>
