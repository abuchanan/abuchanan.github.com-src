<h2>To whom it may concern,</h2>

<div style="margin: 50px 0;">
<p>My name is Mike Morgan, and I am the Director of Web Development at the Mozilla Corporation.  I have worked with Alex at both Oregon State University at the OSU Open Source Lab and here at Mozilla.</p>

<p>I believe that success is best measured by the quality of one's effort.  This is something taught to me by my mentors.  Having that as a yardstick for success, Alex is about as successful as they come.  His effort is exceptional.</p>

<p>There are many things that rely on effort as a foundation: communication, empathy, humility, awareness and industriousness.  If you lack effort, you lack these virtues.  If you put forth high quality effort, you attain them as second nature.  Alex has all of these and then some.</p>

<p>At Mozilla, we have faced many challenges as we've grown.  When Alex was an intern a couple of years ago, we worked under Michael Schroepfer (now VP, Engineering at Facebook).  He excelled at working in a fast-paced environment where he didn't fully understand the systems or technology.  My first impression of Alex was viewing him as a quick learner who was always positive.</p>

<p>Having worked with Alex and being in charge of hiring for the Web Development team, we recruited Alex to work full-time with us after continuing our working relationship with Alex on a contract basis after his internship ended.  As a student he helped with numerous web projects including mozilla.com and addons.mozilla.org -- both sites that receive upwards of 4 to 6 million unique visitors a day.  As a full-time employee, Alex took on a lead developer role working with our main website -- mozilla.com.</p>

<p>Alex grew and flourished in his new role.  He faced tough technical challenges as well as growing pains as Mozilla grew from 100 employees to 300 in a very short period of time.  Through it all, Alex continued to learn, adapt and work well with his colleagues to deliver successful projects on time.  He became an expert with PHP and related frameworks, and when that went out of style and the web development team picked up Python and Django, he learned that seemingly overnight and became proficient with that as well.</p>

<p>I say with high confidence that Alex would be an asset to any team.  The effort and character Alex wields will serve him well in life, and I hope you grasp the opportunity to see it all first-hand.</p>
