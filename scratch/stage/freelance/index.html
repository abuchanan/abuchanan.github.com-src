<p>I've done some freelance work here and there, usually small, simple stuff for a friend in need.</p>

    <h1>Covered Communications</h1>
    <h2>Creation, hosting, IT, and maintenance for a friend's company.</h2>
  {{/block_navify}}
</a>

<a href="#bmrv">
  {{#block_navify}}
    <h1>Brighton Marina and RV</h1>
    <h2>My first website.</h2>
  {{/block_navify}}
</a>

<h2 id="coveredco">Covered Communications - coveredco.com</h2>
<p>I built and maintained this website and other IT tasks for a few years.</p>

<h2 id="bmrv">Brighton Marina and RV - brightonmarinarv.com</h2>
<p>This was the first website I built, and my first time writing HTML, JS, and CSS (which doesn't <em>really</em> count, since I was using Dreamweaver, hah).</p>
<p>I hosted and maintained this website for years, although it's no longer online.</p>
