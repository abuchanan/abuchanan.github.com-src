title: Happy Birthday to You!

I wanted to say a little more than the standard "Thanks for the wishes" note on Facebook.

You see, to celebrate me is really to celebrate you.

Who I am and what I've become I <span style='text-decoration: line-through'>owe to</span>
blame on all of you. I am the sum 
of all the parts, and you are the parts. I am me because you are you.

Whoever you are, whether our paths crossed only briefly or
have long been intertwined, you have an impact on me.

So here's to you: family, best friends, old friends, friends of friends,
ex-girlfriends, coffeeshop crushes, people who I recognize but
don't know your name, strangers in bars.
I love you all! __Thank you__. <br><small>(except you, ya you, you know who you are)</small>

I turned 28 today. I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.
But, I know that wherever I go, I'll have some of the best (and a few of the worst)
people to guide me. I'm cool with that.

Cheers!

<small>Sincerely,
<br>
Your cheesy birthday boy</small>
