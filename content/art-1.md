This was my most involved art project so far.

* Started with rough layout in pencil using 1-point perspective.<br>
  Thanks [Mark Crilley](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCD2CF65888663986)
  for teaching me that.

* "Inked" major lines with a 0.3 micron. My first time working with ink.<br>
  Looked pretty awesome after erasing the rough pencil sketch.

* Added more detail in ink.

* Colored pencil.

* Spent way too long filling in the road with colored pencil, then
  charcoal, then finally a 6B pencil. It was exhausting. Next time I'll use a marker.


Took maybe about 6-8 hours. Some of that was thinking, messing up,
starting over, etc. I'm a new to drawing, so that 6-8 hours is probably a large
percentage of my drawing career.

There's room for more work. I ran out of steam.
I have a whole new appreciation for the amount of work it takes
to make something very detailed.
