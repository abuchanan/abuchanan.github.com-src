I've always wanted to make a game but never have.
Well, it's time to step up to the plate.
<br>
And, since I've started this blog, I figure I may as well document the journey.


The concept
===========

I have only a very rough idea of the style. Here's a sketch:

It's a puzzle game, shown in 2D (or is it [2.5D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D)?).
The player will discover parts of the scene are interactive.
The puzzle is solved by interacting with the scene in the right order and timing to achieve some goal.


The tools
=========

[Unity](http://unity3d.com/) for game development
-------------------------------------------------

Pros

* High-quality.
* Extremely powerful. Handles scene building, animation, scripting, audio, physics, and more.
* Publishes to almost every platform I could think of: desktop, mobile, web, console.
* It's been used to create professional games, some you've probably heard of.
* Most of this comes for free.

Cons

* It doesn't publish to an open web stack (something like javascript + canvas + webgl).

Of course, I'm very biased towards the open web, but in this case I get the sense that there is nothing
in the open web stack that could compare to the amount of effort Unity is going to save me.
Still, maybe some day after getting my feet wet with Unity I can move towards the open web.


[Blender](http://www.blender.org/) for 3D modeling
--------------------------------------------------

Pros

* It's free.
* It's powerful.
* There's a substantial community of Blender users.

Cons

* The user interface is notoriously esoteric,
  but so is [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) (which I use almost every hour of every day)
  so I'm gonna give it a shot.


The next steps
==============

First I'll make a rough version of the scene in Blender. Given that I have about 1 hour of 3D modeling experience, who knows how long that will take.


Interested?
===========

I'd love to hear feedback along the way.<br>

* Have you made a game?
* What did you use?
* What do you think about releasing a game via download/install vs. open web?
* Do you want to get involved with this project? I'd love a teammate.
