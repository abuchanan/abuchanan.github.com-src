* Black charcoal, white colored pencil and pastel.

* First time using a fixative. Prevents the charcoal from smudging, smearing,
  generally being messy. It made the paper curl up, so next time I'll tape
  the paper flat.

* Messed around with some iPhoto settings to export this picture, which
  was pretty cool. Some of the iPhoto adjustments have impressive results.

* He's supposed to be holding a staff on the left, but now that I look again,
  it kinda just looks like a massive lollipop :)

* The paper ripped :(
